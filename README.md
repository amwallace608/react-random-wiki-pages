# react-random-wiki-pages
A rudimentary React app that retrieves uses the Wikipedia API (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to get data for 10 random Wikipedia pages. Created while learning the basics of React development and experimenting with JSON-based APIs.

NOTE: The current version requires that the CORS Changer browser extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US) be installed and enabled
I plan on fixing the CORS issue that causes this requirement in the future, but until then the browser extension is a simple way to work around it.
